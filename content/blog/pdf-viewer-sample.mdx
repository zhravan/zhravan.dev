# PDF Viewer Demo - Sample Document

This post demonstrates the PDF viewer component with an embedded sample document.

## Embedded PDF Viewer

Below is a sample PDF rendered directly in the page with our custom viewer component:

<PDF src="/docs/sample-pdf.pdf" title="Sample PDF Document" height="600px" />

## Features Demonstrated

The PDF viewer includes several useful features:

- **Fullscreen Mode** - Click the fullscreen icon in the top-right toolbar to expand
- **Download Option** - Download the PDF using the download button
- **Open in New Tab** - View the PDF in a separate browser tab
- **Responsive Design** - Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark Mode Compatible** - Automatically adapts to your theme

## Usage

To embed a PDF in your own posts, simply use:

```mdx
<PDF src="/docs/your-file.pdf" title="Your Document" />
```

### With Custom Height

```mdx
<PDF src="/docs/your-file.pdf" title="Your Document" height="700px" />
```

### Advanced Options

For more control, use the `DocumentViewer` component:

```mdx
<DocumentViewer 
  src="/docs/your-file.pdf"
  title="Technical Documentation"
  type="pdf"
  height="800px"
  allowDownload={true}
  allowFullscreen={true}
/>
```

## Where to Store PDFs

Place your PDF files in the `/public` directory:

- `/public/slides/` - For presentation slides
- `/public/docs/` - For documentation and technical papers
- `/public/` - Or any subdirectory structure you prefer

Files in `/public` are accessible at the root URL (e.g., `/docs/sample-pdf.pdf`).

## Try It Out

Use the toolbar buttons above the embedded PDF to:

1. **Download** the sample PDF
2. **Open in new tab** to view in full browser
3. **Enter fullscreen** for distraction-free reading

The viewer works with any PDF file you add to your `/public` directory!
