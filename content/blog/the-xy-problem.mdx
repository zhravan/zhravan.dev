# The XY Problem

He asked how to build X.

Everyone answered.

Libraries. Patterns. Optimizations.
Clean answers to a clean question.

No one asked what X was for.

Weeks later, X worked perfectly.
The problem didn't.

That's the XY problem.
A flawless solution to the wrong thing.

## The Narrow Question

Most people don't ask the wrong questions.
They ask the narrow ones.

They want relief, speed, certainty—
but they ask about tools, techniques, shortcuts.

X feels actionable.
Y feels vague.

So they choose X.

By the time they realize Y was the real goal,
they've already built a beautiful cage around it.

---

## Why We Choose X

The mind loves X because X is controllable.
Y is not.

Y requires admitting uncertainty.
X only requires effort.

So we polish X.
We scale it.
We defend it.

And one day we wake up
very good at something
that never mattered.

That's not a failure of intelligence.
It's a failure of aim.

## The Real Problem

Tech makes this easier to notice,
but it's not about tech.

It's about the gap between
what we think we need
and what we actually need.

Between the symptom
and the disease.

Between the tool
and the purpose.

---

## Asking Better Questions

Before you build X,
ask: what is X for?

Before you optimize,
ask: what are you optimizing for?

Before you scale,
ask: what problem are you solving?

The answer might be Y.

And Y might not need X at all.

---

## The Cage

We build cages because cages are visible.
Because cages feel like progress.

But progress toward what?

A solution that works perfectly
for a problem that doesn't exist
is still a solution.

Just not the one you needed.

---

## Beyond Tech

This isn't unique to programming.

We do it with careers.
With relationships.
With life choices.

We ask: how do I get better at X?
When we should ask: why do I need X?

We ask: what's the fastest way?
When we should ask: where am I going?

---

## The Way Out

The way out isn't complicated.

It's just uncomfortable.

It means admitting you might be wrong.
It means asking questions that don't have easy answers.
It means sitting with uncertainty.

But uncertainty is where real solutions live.

Not in the polished answer.
Not in the perfect implementation.

In the messy, uncertain space
between the question you asked
and the question you should have asked.

That's where Y lives.

And Y is what you actually needed all along.
