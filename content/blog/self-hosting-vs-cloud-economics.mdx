# What Self-Hosting Taught Me About Cloud Economics

<DropCap>I spent $847 on cloud services in 2023.</DropCap>

For side projects. Not production apps serving millions. Just hobby projects, experiments, and tools I built for myself.

$847.

That number made me rethink everything I knew about hosting.

This article is about what happened when I moved from cloud platforms to self-hosting, and what I learned about the economics, trade-offs, and hidden costs on both sides.

Spoiler: Neither option is perfect. Both have costs you don't see coming.

## The Cloud Bill That Woke Me Up

Let me break down where that $847 went:

```
Heroku Hobby Dynos: $7/month × 12 = $84
Heroku Postgres: $9/month × 12 = $108
Vercel Pro (hit hobby limits): $20/month × 12 = $240
Netlify Pro (same story): $19/month × 6 = $114
Railway (before free tier ended): ~$150/year
MongoDB Atlas: $9/month × 8 = $72
AWS S3 + CloudFront: ~$79/year

Total: $847
```

This was for:
- 3 backend APIs (Node.js/Express)
- 2 Next.js apps
- 1 Python data processing script
- 1 MongoDB database
- Static asset hosting

None of these had more than 1,000 monthly active users. Most had less than 100.

**I was paying $847/year to host apps that barely anyone used.**

That's when I asked myself: "What if I just... ran these on my own server?"

---

## The VPS Experiment

I bought a VPS from Hetzner:

**VPS Specs:**
- 4 vCPU cores
- 8 GB RAM
- 160 GB SSD
- 20 TB traffic

**Cost: €9.50/month (~$10.30)**

That's $124/year for a machine that could run **all my projects**.

Let me repeat that: **$124/year instead of $847/year**.

That's an **85% cost reduction**.

  caption="The math was too compelling to ignore"
/>

I thought I'd discovered a cheat code.

> "Why doesn't everyone do this?"

I was about to find out.

---

## Month 1: The Honeymoon Phase

Moving to self-hosting felt like liberation.

I SSH'd into my VPS, installed Docker, and started migrating apps one by one.

```bash
# Deploy an app
docker pull myapp:latest
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 myapp

# Set up Nginx reverse proxy
nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/myapp

# Get free SSL
certbot --nginx -d myapp.com
```

**Everything just worked.**

I deployed all 3 backend APIs, both Next.js apps, and set up PostgreSQL + Redis in Docker containers.

My VPS was humming along at **~40% CPU** and **~3GB RAM usage**. Plenty of headroom.

**Monthly savings: $70**

I felt like a genius.

---

## Month 2: Reality Sets In

Then things started breaking.

**Problem #1: No automatic SSL renewal**

Let's Encrypt certificates expire every 90 days. I forgot to set up auto-renewal.

One morning, all my apps showed SSL warnings. Users (all 12 of them) messaged me: "Your site is broken."

**Solution:** Set up a cron job.

```bash
0 0 1 * * certbot renew --quiet
```

**Time cost: 2 hours debugging + setup**

---

**Problem #2: Monitoring**

One of my APIs crashed. I didn't know for 3 days because I had no monitoring.

On Heroku/Vercel, I'd get emails when things broke. On my VPS? Silence.

**Solution:** Set up Uptime Kuma (self-hosted monitoring).

**Time cost: 3 hours**

---

**Problem #3: Backups**

My VPS provider doesn't do automatic backups (unless you pay extra).

I realized I had **zero backups** of my PostgreSQL database.

**Solution:** Write a backup script.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup PostgreSQL to S3
pg_dump mydb | gzip | aws s3 cp - s3://my-backups/db-$(date +%Y%m%d).sql.gz
```

**Time cost: 4 hours (including testing restores)**

---

**Problem #4: Security**

I left SSH on port 22 with password authentication enabled.

My server got **1,247 failed login attempts** in the first week.

**Solution:**
- Move SSH to non-standard port
- Disable password auth (SSH keys only)
- Set up fail2ban
- Configure UFW firewall

**Time cost: 5 hours**

---

By the end of Month 2, I'd spent **~14 hours** on operational work that cloud platforms handled automatically.

**At my freelance rate ($75/hour), that's $1,050 worth of time.**

Suddenly, that $847 cloud bill didn't look so bad.

---

## The Hidden Costs of Self-Hosting

Self-hosting has **two types of costs**:

### 1. **Direct Costs** (easy to see)

```
VPS: $124/year
Domain: $12/year
Backup storage (S3): ~$24/year
---
Total: $160/year
```

### 2. **Indirect Costs** (hidden)

- **Time spent on setup**: 20 hours initial setup
- **Time spent on maintenance**: ~3 hours/month
- **Time spent on incidents**: Variable (2-10 hours when things break)
- **Mental overhead**: Always worrying "Is my server up?"

Let's do the math:

```
Setup: 20 hours × $75/hour = $1,500 (one-time)
Maintenance: 3 hours/month × 12 × $75 = $2,700/year
Incidents: ~6 hours/year × $75 = $450/year

Total time cost: $4,650/year
```

**Wait, what?**

Even if we reduce my hourly rate to **$25/hour** (undervaluing engineering time):

```
Maintenance: 3 hours/month × 12 × $25 = $900/year
Total: $160 (direct) + $900 (indirect) = $1,060/year
```

That's **more than the cloud bill**.

## When Self-Hosting Makes Sense

After 2 years of self-hosting, here's when it's worth it:

### ✅ **Self-host if:**

**1. You enjoy DevOps work**

If setting up Nginx configs, writing deployment scripts, and debugging server issues **excites you**, self-hosting is great.

It's not a chore; it's a learning experience.

**2. You're running multiple low-traffic projects**

The economics work when you consolidate:

```
10 projects on cloud: $700/year
10 projects on VPS: $124/year (same server)

Savings: $576/year
```

The more projects you run, the better the unit economics.

**3. You need full control**

Cloud platforms have restrictions:
- Heroku: No persistent filesystem
- Vercel: 12-second function timeout
- Netlify: No background jobs

VPS = your machine, your rules.

**4. You're learning infrastructure**

Self-hosting taught me:
- Linux administration
- Networking (DNS, firewalls, load balancers)
- Security hardening
- Monitoring and observability
- Disaster recovery

**These skills are worth way more than $847.**

---

### ❌ **Don't self-host if:**

**1. Your time is expensive**

If you bill at $150/hour as a consultant, spending 3 hours/month on server maintenance costs you $450/month = **$5,400/year**.

At that rate, cloud platforms are a bargain.

**2. You need high reliability**

Cloud platforms have:
- 99.9%+ uptime SLAs
- Automatic failover
- DDoS protection
- 24/7 support

My VPS? If it goes down, I manually restart it. If Hetzner has an outage, I'm screwed.

**3. You need to scale quickly**

Scaling on cloud platforms:
- Vercel: Click a button, deploy to 30+ edge locations
- AWS: Auto-scaling groups handle traffic spikes

Scaling self-hosted:
- Provision new servers (takes hours/days)
- Set up load balancers manually
- Configure database replication

Cloud wins on elasticity.

**4. Your app makes money**

If your project generates $5,000/month, paying $100/month for Heroku is **noise**.

Your time is better spent building features, not managing servers.

---

## The Middle Ground: Hybrid Approach

After 2 years, here's my strategy:

### **Cloud Platforms For:**

- **Frontend apps** (Vercel, Netlify)
  - Global CDN
  - Automatic HTTPS
  - Zero config deployments

- **Production databases** (managed PostgreSQL, Redis)
  - Automatic backups
  - High availability
  - Point-in-time recovery

- **Critical services** (authentication, payments)
  - Can't afford downtime
  - Security is paramount

### **Self-Hosted For:**

- **Backend APIs** (low to medium traffic)
- **Background jobs** (cron, workers)
- **Internal tools** (admin dashboards, monitoring)
- **Development/staging environments**
- **Data-intensive workloads** (where cloud egress costs kill you)

### **Current Monthly Costs:**

```
Vercel Free: $0
Supabase (PostgreSQL): $25
Hetzner VPS: $10
Cloudflare (DNS + CDN): $0
Uptime monitoring: $0 (self-hosted)
---
Total: $35/month = $420/year
```

**Savings: $427/year (50% reduction)**

And I'm sleeping better because critical infrastructure is managed.

## The Real Cost of Cloud

Cloud platforms aren't expensive because they're greedy. They're expensive because of **what you're actually buying**:

### 1. **Expertise**

You're paying for:
- DevOps engineers who manage infrastructure 24/7
- Security teams who patch vulnerabilities
- Network engineers who optimize routing
- Support teams who respond to incidents

**This is a team of 20+ people you don't have to hire.**

### 2. **Reliability**

Cloud platforms invest millions in:
- Redundant data centers
- Load balancing
- DDoS mitigation
- Disaster recovery

**Your VPS has none of this.**

### 3. **Time**

The real cost of self-hosting isn't the $124/year VPS.

It's the **3 AM wake-ups** when your server crashes.

It's the **mental overhead** of "Is everything running?"

It's the **opportunity cost** of time spent on ops instead of building features.

**Cloud platforms buy you time.**

## What I Learned About Economics

### **Lesson 1: Time is not free**

Early in my career, I'd spend 10 hours to save $20/month because "my time is cheap."

Wrong.

**Your time is never cheap.** Even as a junior developer, those 10 hours could've been spent:
- Learning a new skill
- Building a side project
- Contributing to open source
- Networking

All of which compound in value.

### **Lesson 2: Optimize for the bottleneck**

If **money** is your bottleneck: Self-host aggressively.

If **time** is your bottleneck: Pay for cloud.

If **learning** is your bottleneck: Self-host for education, then migrate to cloud.

### **Lesson 3: Scale changes everything**

At 100 users: Self-hosting is cheaper.

At 10,000 users: Depends on your traffic patterns.

At 1M users: Cloud platforms win (unless you're Dropbox-scale and can build your own data centers).

### **Lesson 4: Hidden costs exist on both sides**

**Cloud hidden costs:**
- Egress bandwidth (AWS charges $0.09/GB)
- Vendor lock-in (hard to migrate)
- Feature limitations (no root access)

**Self-hosting hidden costs:**
- Your time (setup, maintenance, incidents)
- Mental overhead (worry, stress)
- Opportunity cost (not building features)

**Neither option is "free" beyond the price tag.**

---

## My Recommendations

### **For Beginners:**

Start with cloud platforms (Vercel, Netlify, Railway).

Learn to ship products first. Infrastructure optimization comes later.

### **For Intermediate Developers:**

Self-host **non-critical projects** to learn infrastructure.

Keep critical apps on cloud platforms.

### **For Advanced Developers:**

Make economic decisions project-by-project:

```
Expected revenue: $0 → Self-host
Expected revenue: $100/month → Cloud
Expected revenue: $10,000/month → Cloud + CDN
Expected revenue: $100,000/month → Hire DevOps engineer
```

### **For Bootstrapped Startups:**

Self-hosting in the early days can extend runway:

```
Scenario A (Cloud):
Monthly burn: $5,000
Runway: 10 months

Scenario B (Self-hosted):
Monthly burn: $4,500
Runway: 11.1 months

Extra time: 1.1 months to find product-market fit
```

**That extra month might save your startup.**

But once you have revenue, migrate to cloud. Your time is more valuable.

## Tools That Changed The Game

These tools made self-hosting viable for me:

### **Deployment:**
- **Docker** - Containerize everything
- **Docker Compose** - Multi-container orchestration
- **Caddy** - Automatic HTTPS (easier than Nginx + Certbot)

### **Monitoring:**
- **Uptime Kuma** - Uptime monitoring
- **Grafana + Prometheus** - Metrics
- **Loki** - Log aggregation

### **Management:**
- **Portainer** - Docker GUI
- **Nixopus** - VPS management platform (shameless plug)
- **Ansible** - Configuration management

### **Security:**
- **Fail2ban** - Brute force protection
- **UFW** - Firewall
- **WireGuard** - VPN for secure access

---

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Here's what I wish someone told me earlier:

> **Self-hosting is not about saving money. It's about control.**

If saving money is your **only** goal, you'll be disappointed.

The time you spend on maintenance will offset the savings.

But if you value:
- **Learning infrastructure**
- **Full control over your stack**
- **Independence from platforms**
- **Owning your deployment pipeline**

Then self-hosting is worth it. **Not for the dollars saved, but for the skills gained.**

---

## Final Breakdown: 2 Years Later

Here's where I landed:

### **Cloud Costs (2023):** $847/year

### **Current Hybrid Costs (2025):** $420/year

**Savings: $427/year**

### **Time Investment:**

- **Year 1:** ~60 hours learning + setup
- **Year 2:** ~30 hours maintenance

**Total: 90 hours over 2 years**

At $50/hour (conservative engineering rate):
- **Time cost:** $4,500
- **Dollar savings:** $854 (2 years)
- **Net cost:** -$3,646

**I paid $3,646 (in time) to save $854.**

**Was it worth it?**

Financially? **No.**

Educationally? **Absolutely.**

The skills I learned are worth 10x the time cost. I now:
- Understand infrastructure deeply
- Can troubleshoot production issues faster
- Make better architectural decisions
- Have confidence to self-host when needed

**I'd do it again.**

But I wouldn't recommend it to everyone.

## Who Should Self-Host?

Ask yourself these questions:

1. **Do you enjoy infrastructure work?**
   - Yes → Self-host
   - No → Cloud

2. **Is your time worth more than $50/hour?**
   - Yes → Cloud (probably)
   - No → Self-host (maybe)

3. **Are you optimizing for learning or shipping?**
   - Learning → Self-host
   - Shipping → Cloud

4. **Do you have 3-5 hours/month for maintenance?**
   - Yes → Self-host
   - No → Cloud

5. **Can you afford 1-2 hours of downtime occasionally?**
   - Yes → Self-host
   - No → Cloud

**If you answered "Cloud" to 3+ questions, stick with cloud platforms.**

---

## Conclusion

Self-hosting taught me that **economics isn't just about money**.

It's about:
- **Time** (How much do you have?)
- **Skills** (What do you want to learn?)
- **Priorities** (What are you optimizing for?)
- **Scale** (How big is your app?)
- **Tolerance** (How much downtime can you accept?)

Cloud platforms are expensive, but they're buying you **time, reliability, and peace of mind**.

Self-hosting is cheap, but costs you **time, energy, and mental overhead**.

**Neither is wrong. Neither is right.**

It depends on where you are in your journey.

For me? I'm somewhere in the middle. Hybrid approach. Cloud for critical stuff, self-hosted for everything else.

And that's okay.
