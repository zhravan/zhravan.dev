# Document Embedding Demo: PDF and PPT Viewer

You can now embed PDF documents and PowerPoint presentations directly in your blog posts! This is perfect for:

- **Conference talks** - Share your slides alongside your talk notes
- **Technical documentation** - Embed whitepapers and specs
- **Tutorials** - Include reference materials
- **Research** - Share academic papers and data

## PDF Example

Here's how a PDF looks embedded in a post:

<PDF 
  src="/docs/sample-pdf.pdf" 
  title="Sample PDF Document"
  height="500px"
/>

### Usage

```mdx
<PDF 
  src="/slides/my-presentation.pdf" 
  title="My Presentation"
  height="500px"
/>
```

## PowerPoint Example

PowerPoint presentations are embedded via Microsoft Office Online Viewer:

<PPT 
  src="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/embed.aspx?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skalavala/smarthome/master/documents/BRUH%20Automation%20-%20Getting%20Started.pptx"
  title="Sample PowerPoint Presentation"
  height="500px"
/>

### Usage

```mdx
<PPT 
  src="https://example.com/presentation.pptx" 
  title="Conference Talk 2024"
/>
```

## Features

### 1. Fullscreen Mode

Click the fullscreen icon in the viewer toolbar to expand documents to full screen.

### 2. Download Option

Readers can download documents with the download button in the toolbar.

### 3. Open in New Tab

The external link icon opens the document in a new browser tab.

### 4. Responsive Design

The viewer adapts to different screen sizes and works on mobile devices.

### 5. Dark Mode Compatible

The viewer UI respects your site's theme (try toggling dark mode!).

## Best Practices

### File Size

- Keep PDFs under 10MB for fast loading
- Optimize PDFs before uploading (remove unused resources)
- Consider offering both embedded and download options for large files

### Hosting

- **Local hosting**: Place files in `/public/slides/` or `/public/docs/`
- **External hosting**: Ensure PowerPoint files are publicly accessible
- **CDN**: Consider using a CDN for frequently accessed documents

### Accessibility

```mdx
<PDF 
  src="/slides/presentation.pdf" 
  title="Descriptive title for screen readers"
/>
```

Always include a descriptive `title` prop for accessibility.

### Mobile Experience

While viewers work on mobile, consider adding download links:

```mdx
<PDF src="/slides/deck.pdf" title="My Talk" />

*[Download PDF](/slides/deck.pdf) (2.5 MB) - better for mobile*
```

## Advanced Options

### Custom Height

```mdx
<DocumentViewer 
  src="/docs/whitepaper.pdf"
  height="700px"
/>
```

### Disable Features

```mdx
<DocumentViewer 
  src="/presentation.pdf"
  allowDownload={false}
  allowFullscreen={false}
/>
```

### Auto-detect Type

The component automatically detects file type from extension:

```mdx
<DocumentViewer src="/file.pdf" type="auto" />
```

## Use Cases

Perfect for sharing talk slides with blog posts:

```mdx

## Styling

The viewer inherits your site's design system:

- Border colors match your theme
