# Bit Wars: 32-bit vs 64-bit Systems Explained

## Explainer

- A 64-bit system is like a highway, while a 32-bit system is like a bypass road.

- A 64-bit system allows more data to be transmitted simultaneously, resulting in improved overall speed and performance.

## Additional Context

<Tip>
  A 64-bit system can handle more data at once than 32-bit, like using 64
  fingers instead of 32, hence the analogy of a Highway with multiple lanes and
  Bypass road with 2 lanes.
